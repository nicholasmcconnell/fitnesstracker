Commit Early and Often
One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:


Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills


Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state


Follow these guidelines for committing:


Make single purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits


Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history


Don't commit half done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!)


Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process


We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
